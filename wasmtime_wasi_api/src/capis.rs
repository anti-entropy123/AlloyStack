/// example this would be invoked during a signal handler on Linux. This
/// function is passed a number of parameters indicating information about the
/// trap:
///
/// * `ip` - the instruction pointer at the time of the trap.
/// * `fp` - the frame pointer register's value at the time of the trap.
/// * `has_faulting_addr` - whether this trap is associated with an access
///   violation (e.g. a segfault) meaning memory was accessed when it shouldn't
///   be. If this is `true` then the next parameter is filled in.
/// * `faulting_addr` - if `has_faulting_addr` is true then this is the address
///   that was attempted to be accessed. Otherwise this value is not used.
///
/// If this function returns then the trap was not handled by Wasmtime. This
/// means that it's left up to the embedder how to deal with the trap/signal
/// depending on its default behavior. This could mean forwarding to a
/// non-Wasmtime handler, aborting the process, logging then crashing, etc. The
/// meaning of a trap that's not handled by Wasmtime depends on the context in
/// which the trap was generated.

/// When this function does not return it's because `wasmtime_longjmp` is
/// used to handle a Wasm-based trap.
